ISO8583Engine:

This is a simple API to create a ISO8583 Request object as well as parse the ISO8583
response using a configurable xml file.  

Keys are the values ala variable declared in a program, each value's index should be unique,
on-us values are allowed in Keys section. All the key values are resolved at the time of the
creation of the ISO8583Message object. If the key value is an on-us value, the final value is
then padded with upto the length specified by the Length attribute.

The "on-us" values are supplied at the runtime as a Dictionary, we try to access these values
using the key supplied after the on-us identifier, so the values are completely dependent on 
the supplier, thus the xml and the program should be in synchonization, try to keep the On-Us
values as general as possible, allowing minimum change in the code. 

The ISO8583 Fields are organised as categories. In the above example, the Category "Common"
contains all the fields common to both the update as well as the account info ISO8583 request.
The category "Update" contains the field belonging to update request whereas the category
"AccountInfo" contains fields belonging to account request. 

The Category "Response" is a special one, it only contains those fields which are not present
in any of the requests but in the response sent by the CBS. Thus, the Category "Response"
cannot be used to create any request. If Used, the engine will throw an ArgumentException.

We ask the ISO8583 engine to generate a request, we do it by supplying the categories. 
eg: to generate a complete update request we will have to combine categories "Common" and "Update".

However, you cannot combine categories containing the same field indexes, or from the category
"Response" eg: You cannot combine the categories "Update" and "AccountInfo", because both contain
the field 3 as their part. 

Multiple values in an ISO8583Field can be combined by using the '+' operator. If one of those 
values is a dynamic value, it is resolved at the time of the ISO8583Message creation.

'|' is used to denote user defined padding in the ISO8583Field. Dynamic fields with '|' operator 
is resolved only when the Header value is zero, viz the ISOField value is padded upto the length 
of the MaxLength by spaces. The positioning of the '|' informs the engine to either perform left 
or right padding. If the value is to be required to be padded with any other value than
space, specify the padding charachter on the other side of the '|' operator.

"time" accessor is used to insert datetime values, accessor is followed the datetime format,
for different formats refer the "C# Datetime Formats".
Note: the format is placed exactly as its provided, so keep a watch on the case sensitivity.
