ISO8583Engine:

This is a simple API to create a ISO8583 Request object as well as parse the ISO8583
response using a configurable xml file.  

Keys are the values ala variable declared in a program, each value's index should be unique,
on-us values are allowed in Keys section. All the key values are resolved at the time of the
creation of the ISO8583Engine_Message object. 

The On-Us values are supplied at the runtime as a string array, we try to access these values
using array index, so the values are completely dependent on the supplier, thus the xml and
the program should be in synchonization, try to keep the On-Us values as general as possible,
allowing minimum change in the code. 

The ISO8583 Fields are organised as categories. In the above example, the Category "Common"
contains all the fields common to both the update as well as the account info ISO8583 request.
The category "Update" contains the field belonging to update request whereas the category
"AccountInfo" contains fields belonging to account request. 

The Category "Response" is a special one, it only contains those fields which are not present
in any of the requests but in the response sent by the CBS. Thus, the Category "Response"
cannot be used to create any request. If Used the engine will throw an error.

When we ask the ISO8583 engine to generate a request, we do it by supplying the categories. 
eg: to generate a complete update request we will have to combine categories "0" and "1".

However, you cannot combine categories containing the same field indexes, or from the category
"Response" eg: You cannot combine the categories "Update" and "AccountInfo", because both contain
the field 3 as their part. 

So if the same field is contained by all the requests 

Also the field values cannot contain +,| and : as they are used by the engine logic

"time:" accessor is used to insert datetime values, accessor is followed the datetime format,
for different formats refer the "C# Datetime Format"
Note: the format is placed exactly as its provided, so keep a watch on the case sensitivity.
